# BlackParrot Software Developer Guide

## Overview
This document is intended to provide software and firmware developers with platform level specifications necessary to develop for BlackParrot. It is a work in progress. Following the full Getting Started guide in the main BlackParrot is the best way to prepare for BlackParrot software development.

## Architectural Details
Currently implemented in BlackParrot is:
* RV64IMA_Zfencei (Integer, Multiply/Divide, Atomics and Fence.i) User-mode ISA v2.00
* MSU (Machine, Supervisor and User) privilege levels conforming to Privileged Architecture v1.11
* SV39 virtual memory with 40 bit physical address

## Building a Test
BlackParrot test suites live in `bp_common/test/src` and are compiled with `make -C bp_common/test <test suite>.`. When a suite is compiled, it creates a set of files in `bp_common/test/mem/<suite>`. There are also a number of potential generate targets that are useful for simulation, but are generally handled automatically by the build system. The targets include:
* .riscv (the elf file)
* .dump (a disassembly of the test)
* .spike (a spike commit log showing a run of the test)
* .mem (a Verilog hex format file, used to load memories in a simulation)
* .nbf (network boot file format, used to dma a program into BlackParrot memories, for example in FPGA)
  * The file format is (size(in 2^N bytes)_address(40 bit)_data(size bits)
    * 03_0080000000_ffd1011b00090137 = 8 bytes, address 0x8000_0000, data ffd1011b00090137

## Adding a Test
Adding a new test to BlackParrot is easy. Simply add the new test C file in bp_common/test/src/demos/src/, add to the test list in bp_common/test/demos/Makefile.frag, and it should build as part of the demos suite.

## Adding a New Test Suite
To add a new test suite, add a submodule containing the suite to bp_common/test/src. This submodule should have a makefile at the toplevel to build each program in the directory with a .riscv extension. In bp_common/test/Makefile.tests, add a call to submodule_test_template and the submodule will automatically sync and build with make -C bp_common/test <suite name>. 

## Building a Checkpoint Test
BlackParrot can use Dromajo to generate checkpoints for certain tests. It runs the test on Dromajo for a certain number of instructions and then generates a memory image and a nbf file which contains the internal architectural state of the core(PC, registers, CSRs, privilege mode, ...). To create the checkpoint simply make sure that the target test is already built in the `bp_common/test/mem` directory and run `make <test>.dromajo MAXINSN=<n>` which will generate the files under the `<test>.dromajo.<n>` name. You can also specify the memory size of the image with `MEMSIZE=<k in MB>`. Default value is 1MB which should be enough for the small tests.

To run the RTL simulation from the checkpoint, we have to run it with `PRELOAD_MEM_P=1 LOAD_NBF_P=1`. The former preloads the memory from the `.mem` file instead of using the nbf loader, and the latter loads the rest of state into the cores through the nbf loader.
### Example:
    cd <TOP>/bp_common/test
    make demos
    make bs.dromajo MAXINSN=5000
    cd <TOP>/bp_top/syn
    make build.v sim.v PROG=bs.dromajo.5000 PRELOAD_MEM_P=1 LOAD_NBF_P=1

## Cosimulation
BlackParrot also uses Dromajo to verify the correct execution of the program. It is done through comparing the commit information with the ideal C model in Dromajo using DPI calls in RTL in simulation runtime. To enable cosimulation simply run the RTL simulation  with `COSIM_P=1` flag.

The DPI calls which are used in the nonsynth cosim module are listed below. `init_dromajo` initializes a Dromajo model instance with a config file which includes pointers to Dromajo checkpoint files, and is called once at the beginning of the simulation. `dromajo_step` is called whenever we commit an instruction in RTL, and it compares the commit information with Dromajo and prints an error message if they diverge. Finally `dromajo_trap` is used to notify Dromajo about an interrupt event in RTL so the C model can follow the same program flow, because the C model cannot precisely predict interrupts beforehand due to their asynchronous nature.

* void init_dromajo(char* cfg_f_name);
* void dromajo_step(int hart_id, uint64_t pc, uint32_t insn, uint64_t wdata);
* void dromajo_trap(int hart_id, uint64_t cause);

**Note:** Currently cosimulation only works with the single-core system.

## Test Libraries
### libperch
libperch is the BlackParrot firmware library. It includes sample linker scripts for supported SoC platforms, start code for running bare-metal tests, emulation code for missing instructions and firmware routines for printing, serial input and output and program termination.

libperch is automatically compiled as part of the toplevel `make progs` target. In order to manually compile libperch, execute `make -C bp_common/test perch`. When compiled in this way, libperch.a is installed to `bp_common/test/lib`. Users should link this library when compiling a new program for BlackParrot.
  
### PanicRoom (aka bsg_newlib)
PanicRoom is a port of newlib which packages a DRAM-based filesystem (LittleFS) along with a minimal C library. By only implementing a few platform level operations, PanicRoom provides an operational filesystem, eliminating the need for a complex host interface, It is automatically included with the standard toolchain build, allowing benchmarks such as SPEC to run with minimal host overhead. For an example of how to use PanicRoom, see bp_common/test/src/spec/README.

## Testbench Helper Modules
BlackParrot provides a minimal MMIO host interface in order to run tests that do require off-chip
I/O. The unit, bp_nonsynth_host is instantiated in the testbench. It provides
* getchar = 0x0010_0000
* putchar = 0x0010_1000
* finish = 0x0010_2000

Additionally, there are tracers provided in the testbench which bind into the module and provide
output logs for use in debugging. Because these reports are sometimes very large, tracing is an
"opt-in" feature. A more streamlined process to enable these tracers and see results is in the works. In order to enable a tracer, simply add the parameter to the make command used to build.  For example make build.v sim.v DRAM_TRACE_P=1 will enable the dram tracer.

Currently, the list of tracing parameters is:
* CALC_TRACE_P - prints the state of the pipeline every cycle
* CCE_TRACE_P - prints each coherence transaction
* CMT_TRACE_P - prints each committed instruction along with register modifications
* DRAM_TRACE_P - prints each dram access
* NPC_TRACE_P - prints each (speculative) PC executed by the BE
* DCACHE_TRACE_P - prints each load/store
* VM_TRACE_P - prints each TLB fill
* CORE_PROFILE_P - prints a cycle-accurate stall trace
