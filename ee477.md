# Black Parrot Project

We will going to do the part d, which is making icache suitable for 32 KB 8 associativity to 16-4,8-2,4-1

## Pointer to Benefits of Optimization
By reducing the size and associativity of the i-cache, we can reduce the power concumption and reducing the area. 

## Problem
At beginning, the data shows our area not dereased, but increased a lot. After close to examine the reason, we find out that we do not have hardened memory for new sizes and associativity. Therefore, we add several lines inside bsg_mem_1rw_mask.v inside ee477-chip/hard/memory folder to claim new memory. Also, we have create several new .cfg file to build new memories.
