# coming-soon
Black Parrot is coming soon.

To run the demo code:

Fetch the latest bsg_ip_cores with:

git submodule update

NOTE: Some users are reporting access issues with the submodule.  If this is you, instead delete the git submodule and clone directly from bitbucket into the same place as the original submodule (even level with bp_be, bp_top, etc.)
https://bitbucket.org/taylor-bsg/bsg_ip_cores/src/master/

cd bp_top/syn

The general command to run a test program with a testbench wrapper (found in bp_top/test/tb) is
make TEST_ROM=<rom from test/rom/v/> <wrapper>.run.v

For example,

make TEST_ROM=rv64ui_p_add_rom.v bp_single_demo.run.v

make TEST_ROM=hello_world_rom.v bp_single_demo.run.v

make TEST_ROM=queue_demo_rom.v bp_dual_demo.run.v

This command also works for system wrappers found in bp_be.  For example:
You must first 

cd bp_be/tb/asm && make && make -f Makefile.demo, which will generate all of the test roms in bp_be/tb/rom

then

make TEST_ROM=rv64ui_p_ld_rom.v bp_be_nonsynth_mock_fe_top_wrapper.run.v

Other tests may or may not run based on this command.  In those cases, running 'make' in the test directory should run the test. Else, contact petrisko@cs.washington.edu who can direct you to the correct implementor.

NOTE: Currently, BlackParrot requires a VCS license.  Work in is progress to adapt the project to Verilator (https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator), an open-source simulator.  At the moment, for the purpose of this pre-alpha release, please contact petrisko@cs.washington.edu for help massaging your own VCS setup into this build flow (or pull-request a working Verilator build =))
