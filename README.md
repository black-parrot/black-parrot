# BlackParrot: A Linux-Capable Accelerator Host RISC-V Multicore [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) [![Gitlab CI](https://gitlab.com/bespoke-silicon-group/black-parrot/black-parrot/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/bespoke-silicon-group/black-parrot/black-parrot/pipelines) [![Contributers](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/black-parrot/black-parrot.svg?style=flat)]()

BlackParrot aims to be the default open-source, Linux-capable, cache-coherent, RV64GC+ multicore used by the world.
Although originally developed by the University of Washington and Boston University, BlackParrot strives to be community-driven and infrastructure agnostic, a core which is Pareto optimal in terms of power, performance, area and complexity.
In order to ensure BlackParrot is easy to use, integrate, modify and trust, development is guided by three core principles: Be Tiny, Be Modular, and Be Friendly.
Development efforts have prioritized ease of use and silicon validation as first order design metrics, so that users can quickly get started and trust that their results will be representative of state-of-the-art ASIC designs.
BlackParrot is ideal as the basis for a lightweight accelerator host, a standalone Linux core, or as a hardware research platform.

## The BlackParrot manifesto

- Be TINY
    - When deliberating between two options, consider the one with least hardware cost/complexity
- Be Modular
    - Prevent tight coupling between modules by designing latency insenstive interfaces
- Be Friendly
    - Combat NIH, welcome external contributions and strive for infrastructure agnosticism

## Environments

This RTL repo is intended to be used with a specific [SDK](https://github.com/black-parrot-sdk/) and [HDK](https://github.com/black-parrot-hdk/) depending on the simulation / FPGA / ASIC environment desired.
For first-time users of BlackParrot, we recommend starting from the [BlackParrot Simulation Environment](https://github.com/black-parrot/black-parrot-sim), which packages the BlackParrot RTL and SDK in a compatible manner.
We intend to release several examples of BlackParrot environments which package the RTL, SDK and HDK together for evaluation.
Currently, [BlackParrot Simulation](https://github.com/black-parrot/black-parrot-sim) and [ZynqParrot](https://github.com/black-parrot-hdk/zynq-parrot) are supported.
Users can of course set up their own environments based on these examples.

## Getting started

Generally, this repo is included as part of a complete simulation environment.
However, the libraries can be build directly here as well.
For most users, the following makefile targets will be the most useful:

    make libs_lite;     # minimal set of simulation libraries
    make libs;          # standard libraries
    make libs_bsg;      # additional libs for BSG users

There are also common Makefile targets to maintain the repository:

    make checkout;      # checkout submodules. Should be done before building libs
    make help;          # prints information about documented targets
    make bleach_all;    # wipes the whole repo clean. Use with caution

And some lesser tested, maintenance operations

    make clean;          # cleans up submodule working directory
    make tidy;           # unpatches submodules
    make bleach;         # deinitializes submodules

Once you have a BlackParrot environment set up, you can follow the RTL evaluation guide here to
test the core RTL: [Evaluation Guide](docs/eval_guide.md)

## How to contribute

Although information in collected in this repo, it's recommended to look at these [Slides](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/riscv_blackparrot/attachments/slides/3718/export/events/attachments/riscv_blackparrot/slides/3718/Talk_Slides) for a quick overview of BlackParrot.

We welcome external contributions!
Please join our mailing list at [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/black-parrot), ask questions or just tell us how you're using BlackParrot!
For a smooth contribution experience, take a look at our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Software development kit
BlackParrot is Linux-capable, so it is possible to run all programs which run on BusyBox. However,
for more targeted benchmarks which don't want O/S management overheads (or the overheads of a long
Linux boot time in simulation!), it is preferable to write for bare-metal. Additionally, some
platform-specific features are only available at the firmware level. Developers looking to write
low-level BlackParrot code, or optimize for the BlackParrot platform should look at our [SDK](https://github.com/black-parrot-sdk/black-parrot-sdk).

## Accelerator Developer Guide

The specific instructions here are outdated; help wanted to resurrect examples and re-document!

## Hardware Development Kit
[BlackParrot Subsystems](https://github.com/black-parrot-hdk/black-parrot-subsystems)

## Interface Specification
BlackParrot heavily leverages the [BaseJump STL](https://github.com/bespoke-silicon-group/basejump_stl) library and builds upon many of the hardware design conventions from the corresponding [BSG SystemVerilog Coding Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xA5XUzBtz_D6aSyIBQUwFk_kSUdckrfxa2uzGjMgmCU/edit#) which can aid in understanding how BlackParrot source code works.

BlackParrot is an aggressively modular design: communication between the components is performed over a set of narrow, latency-insensitive interfaces. The interfaces are designed to allow implementations of the various system components to change independently of one another, without worrying about cascading functional or timing effects. Read more about BlackParrot's standardized interfaces here: [Interface Specification](docs/interface_specification.md)

## BedRock Cache Coherence System Guide
The BedRock coherence system maintains cache coherence between the BlackParrot processor cores and
attached coherent accelerators in a BlackParrot multicore system. Please see the
[BedRock Cache Coherence System Guide](docs/bedrock_guide.md) page for more details on the cache
coherence protocol and its implementation in BlackParrot.

## CAD Backend Guide
A key feature of using BlackParrot is that it has been heavily validated in both silicon and FPGA implementations.  All BlackParrot tapeouts and FPGA environments can be found at [BlackParrot Examples](https://github.com/black-parrot-examples/). Taped out BlackParrot yourself and want to share tips and tricks? Let us know and we can add it to the collection! Looking to implement BlackParrot in a physical system? Take a look at our [CAD Backend Guide](docs/backend_guide.md).

## Continuous Integration
Upon commit to the listed branch, a functional regression consisting of full-system tests and module level tests is run and checked for correctness. Additionally, the design is checked with Synopsys DC to verify synthesizability. Work is in progress to continuously monitor PPA.

## Help us out

Our goal with BlackParrot is to bootstrap a community-maintained RISC-V core, and we would love for you to get involved. Here are a few starter projects you could do to get your feet wet! Contact us more for details.

- Our integer divider could be parameterized to iterate faster on smaller numbers. (Note: Currently somebody is working on this.)
- We could use a stream buffer (prefetcher) implementation for our L2 cache.
- Add a parameter to enable / disable FPU logic (including register file, bypass paths, FP divider and FMAC, etc.)
- Improve the mapping to FPGA
  - We use a [portability layer for FPGA](https://github.com/bespoke-silicon-group/basejump_stl/blob/master/hard/ultrascale_plus) that can be optimized, e.g.,
  - Other mappings, such the multiplier to DSP48, could be improved.
  - We have not looked at frequency tuning BP for FPGA at all. The ideal changes would not result in much ASIC/FPGA code bifurcation.
- We always appreciate pull requests to fix bugs in the documentation, or bug reports that instructions don't work correctly.
- The RISC-V GCC compiler has some inefficiencies that we have identified, if you have compiler experience you could raise the benchmark numbers for all RISC-V cores versus other ISA's!
- Our current L2 cache implementation (bsg\_cache) is blocking. We would like a non-blocking implementation that supports the same interface and features as the current one, so that can be a configuration option for BlackParrot. It may even be possible to reuse the current code. Contact us to discuss possible implementation approaches! This is an advanced project, after you have already completed an intermediate project.

## Have us help you out

We're happy to help advise BlackParrot projects, but have limited bandwidth for technical support.
Please read all documentation carefully and follow all user guides. We only offically support Centos 7 and Ubuntu 20.04 so
we cannot troubleshoot environment issues on other OSes. We appreciate PRs to clarify and correct documentation!

Upon finding an issue, the procedure should be:
- Attempt the build in a container using the Docker image in [black-parrot-sim](https://github.com/black-parrot/black-parrot-sim), following all documented instructions. Make sure the issue does not exist solely on your machine.
- After confirming it is not an environment issue, trace the error to the earliest source. For instance, "./simsc not found" means that we should check why simsc is not getting built in an earlier step.
- Search the internet for the root error and attempt solutions from Stack Overflow, EDAboard, or other public forums. Chances are you are not the first to run into it.
- Raise a Github issue with the results of your search. Include the root error, your debugging steps and any proposed solutions.
- Work with maintainers to determine a solution and contribute back to the community by providing the fix.

Due to our open-source nature, we greatly prefer answering questions in the open via
Github issues, so that others can benefit from the knowledge. Please only send personal emails to
maintainers for sensitive academic or commercial opportunities (keeping in mind that this is an
open-source project maintained by energetic but not inexhaustible volunteers).
